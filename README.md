# 🌐 My HTML Journey

Welcome to my HTML repository!  
This is not a tutorial or a learning resource—it's a reflection of **my personal journey** with HTML, from the very basics to creating complete web pages.

## 📌 What This Repo Is About

This repo documents my step-by-step progress as I explored HTML:
- Starting with the simplest tags like `<p>` and `<h1>`
- Experimenting with lists, tables, and forms
- Structuring semantic HTML
- Creating small but complete web pages

Each file represents a milestone, a "checkpoint" in my learning. It's raw, real, and 100% me.

## 📁 Structure

You'll find multiple `.html` files in this repo, each named based on what I was exploring at the time. Some may be simple, others more advanced—but all were created as part of my learning journey.

## 🙋‍♀️ Why I Made This

I wanted a place where I could:
- Track my growth
- Look back at how far I’ve come
- Keep all my HTML practice in one place

## 💬 Final Note

If you’re here just browsing: welcome!  
If you're also on your learning journey, I hope this inspires you to document yours too 💫
